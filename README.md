Chest xray image classification using transfer learning with GPU in ml.net

Dataset that use I have found here https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/

Transfer learning was usend on ResnetV2101 model. I have tried few more pretrained mode, but ResnetV2101 gave me best results.

Training was done with GPU.

Model generated can classify chest xray images with pneumonia and without pneumonia.
